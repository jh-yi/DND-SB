We present the Deep Nutrient Deficiency for Sugar Beet (DND-SB) dataset, which contains 5648 RGB images of sugar beet captured over the whole growth period in 2019  at the long term fertilizerexperiment (LTFE) Dikopshof near Bonn. The images were annotated with seven types of fertilizer treatments. The dataset is used for image classification and domain adaptation.
